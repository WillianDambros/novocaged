Downloading and decoding novocaged

This code aims to download and prepare the NOVOCAGED files to be used in descriptive statistics.

I especially thank the professor who taught me R professor @roneyfraga and my co-worker Paula Luciana Silva for making writing this code possible. And to all those who contributed in some way.
In the future the project is to be able to use the data in other ways.
